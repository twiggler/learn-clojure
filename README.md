# Learning Clojure

Learning clojure by programmatically solving the puzzles of the video
game ["11th Hour."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_11th_Hour_(video_game))

I played this game when I was a child, but never completed it. At the time, I was amazed by the graphics; now, the experience 
is unfortunately ruined by the bad writing.
